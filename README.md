# Les Pigeonneaux Gourmands

(*hungry pigeons*)

This work is part of UQAC's course "Advanced Oriented Object Project". It's goal is to work with thread synchronization and JavaFX.

## Rules

The project simulates the behaviour of pigeons on a public place. They will get attracted when they see some food, they won't eat it if they see it's not fresh, and they will sometimes get scared.

## Controls

**`Left click`** Add a pigeon to the square

**`Right click`** Add food to the square

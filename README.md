# Les Pigeonneaux Gourmands

(*hungry pigeons*)

This work is part of UQAC's course "Advanced Oriented Object Project". It's goal is to work with thread synchronization and JavaFX. Work with Java 10 only (changes in JavaFX between JDK versions).

## Rules

The project simulates the behaviour of pigeons on a public place. They will get attracted when they see some food, they won't eat it if they see it's not fresh (2s after being add), and they will sometimes get scared by a rock.

## Controls

**`Left click`** Add a pigeon to the square

**`Right click`** Add food to the square

**`Space bar`** Add a rock to scare de pigeon (only one at a time)
